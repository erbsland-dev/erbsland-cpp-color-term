Buffer Views
************

Buffer views expose a rectangular window onto a larger readable buffer.

They are the right tool whenever your logical content is larger than the
visible terminal area—for example in scrollable panels, editors, minimaps,
or diagnostic tools.

:cpp:any:`BufferViewBase <erbsland::cterm::BufferViewBase>` provides the shared view behavior,
:cpp:any:`BufferView <erbsland::cterm::BufferView>` owns a shared pointer to the underlying content, and
:cpp:any:`BufferConstRefView <erbsland::cterm::BufferConstRefView>` is the lightweight, stack-friendly variant
for temporary rendering.

Usage
=====

Viewing a Portion of a Larger Buffer
------------------------------------

Use a buffer view when you want to render only a specific region of a
larger logical canvas.

.. code-block:: cpp

    auto world = Buffer{Size{120, 40}};
    world.fill(Char{" ", Color{fg::Inherited, bg::Black}});
    world.drawText("Visible window", Rectangle{10, 6, 20, 3}, Alignment::Center);

    auto view = BufferConstRefView{world, Rectangle{8, 4, 40, 12}};

    auto settings = UpdateSettings{};
    settings.setShowCropMarks(true);
    terminal.updateScreen(view, settings);

The view translates its local coordinates into the corresponding
positions of the underlying buffer. This allows you to render just the
visible portion without copying or modifying the original content.

Scrolling by Moving the View Rectangle
--------------------------------------

:cpp:any:`BufferViewBase <erbsland::cterm::BufferViewBase>` stores the currently visible rectangle, which you can
update as the user scrolls or pans through the content.

.. code-block:: cpp

    auto sharedWorld = std::make_shared<Buffer>(world);
    auto view = BufferView{sharedWorld, Rectangle{0, 0, 40, 12}};

    view.setViewRect(Rectangle{16, 10, 40, 12});
    terminal.updateScreen(view);

By moving the view rectangle, you change which part of the content is
visible—without copying, reallocating, or redrawing the underlying buffer.

Choosing Between Shared and Referenced Views
--------------------------------------------

Choose :cpp:any:`BufferView <erbsland::cterm::BufferView>` when the view needs to outlive the current scope or be
stored as part of a larger object.

Choose :cpp:any:`BufferConstRefView <erbsland::cterm::BufferConstRefView>` when you only need a short-lived wrapper
around an existing buffer.

.. code-block:: cpp

    auto sharedBuffer = std::make_shared<Buffer>(Size{80, 24});
    auto cachedView = BufferView{sharedBuffer, Rectangle{4, 4, 30, 10}};

    auto preview = BufferConstRefView{*sharedBuffer, Rectangle{0, 0, 20, 6}};
    terminal.updateScreen(preview);

Both variants implement :cpp:any:`ReadableBuffer <erbsland::cterm::ReadableBuffer>`, so the rest of your rendering
pipeline can treat them just like any other source of terminal cells.

Showing Cropped Edges Explicitly
--------------------------------

:cpp:any:`CropEdges <erbsland::cterm::CropEdges>` describes which sides of a view are clipped by the available
content.

:cpp:any:`BufferViewBase <erbsland::cterm::BufferViewBase>` can use this information to render custom crop indicators
directly inside the view.

.. code-block:: cpp

    auto sharedBuffer = std::make_shared<Buffer>(world);
    auto view = BufferView{sharedBuffer, Rectangle{8, 4, 40, 12}};

    view.setShowCropCharacters(true);
    view.setCropCharacter(Direction::East, Char{U'▶', fg::BrightYellow});
    view.setCropCharacter(Direction::South, Char{U'▼', fg::BrightYellow});

    const auto cropEdges = CropEdges::fromView(view.viewRect(), sharedBuffer->rect());
    if (cropEdges.isSet(Direction::East)) {
        terminal.printLine("There is more content to the right.");
    }

This is especially helpful in scrollable views, where users should
immediately recognize that additional content exists beyond the visible
window.

If you are already using the UI framework, see
:cpp:any:`ui::ScrollingBufferView <erbsland::cterm::ui::surface::ScrollingBufferView>`
for the same concept packaged as a ready-to-use surface with scroll and
page navigation helpers.
