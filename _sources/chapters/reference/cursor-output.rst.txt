Cursor Output
*************

Cursor output is the shared streaming API used by
:cpp:any:`Terminal <erbsland::cterm::Terminal>` and
:cpp:any:`CursorBuffer <erbsland::cterm::CursorBuffer>`.

:cpp:any:`CursorWriter <erbsland::cterm::CursorWriter>` combines cursor movement, active color state,
active character attributes, plain text output, and paragraph printing into a single, consistent interface.
:cpp:any:`MoveMode <erbsland::cterm::MoveMode>` distinguishes between absolute and relative cursor movement.

Use this API when you want to print mixed text and color arguments, write
terminal-style output into a :cpp:any:`CursorBuffer <erbsland::cterm::CursorBuffer>`, or precisely control cursor
positioning.

This page documents the shared output model only. Screen lifecycle,
full-screen rendering, refresh settings, and backend ownership remain on
:doc:`terminal`.

Usage
=====

Printing Mixed Arguments
------------------------

:cpp:any:`CursorWriter <erbsland::cterm::CursorWriter>` is designed for fluent, terminal-style output.

The ``print()`` and ``printLine()`` functions accept a mix of colors,
character styles, character attributes, terminal strings, and plain text
in a single call. As arguments are processed, the active color and
attribute state is updated automatically.

.. code-block:: cpp

    terminal.printLine(
        fg::BrightGreen,
        "Service started at ",
        fg::BrightWhite,
        "09:42");

    terminal.print(
        bg::BrightBlack,
        fg::BrightYellow,
        "[Q] ",
        fg::BrightWhite,
        "quit");

    auto emphasis = CharAttributes{};
    emphasis.setBold(true);
    emphasis.setUnderline(true);
    const auto headingStyle = CharStyle{Color{fg::BrightWhite, bg::Inherited}, emphasis};

    terminal.printLine(
        headingStyle,
        "Important",
        CharAttributes::reset(),
        fg::BrightBlack,
        " uses both bold and underline.");

Because the active color and attribute state is part of the writer,
subsequent output continues using the most recently selected values
until you change them again or call
:cpp:any:`CursorWriter::setDefaultColor() <erbsland::cterm::CursorWriter::setDefaultColor()>`.
Use :cpp:any:`CharAttributes::reset() <erbsland::cterm::CharAttributes::reset()>`
when you want to explicitly turn all attributes back off.
Use :cpp:any:`CursorWriter::style() <erbsland::cterm::CursorWriter::style()>`
and :cpp:any:`CursorWriter::setStyle() <erbsland::cterm::CursorWriter::setStyle()>`
when you want to read or update the combined style in one step.

Moving the Cursor Explicitly
----------------------------

Use :cpp:any:`MoveMode <erbsland::cterm::MoveMode>` when you need to control whether a movement is
relative to the current cursor position or absolute within the writable area.

.. code-block:: cpp

    cursorBuffer.moveCursor(Position{10, 3}, MoveMode::Absolute);
    cursorBuffer.print("Header");

    cursorBuffer.moveCursor(Position{0, 2}, MoveMode::Relative);
    cursorBuffer.printLine("First entry");

All convenience functions—such as ``moveLeft()``, ``moveRight()``,
``moveUp()``, ``moveDown()``, ``moveTo()``, and ``moveHome()``—are built
on top of this same distinction.

VT100-Compatible Line Wrapping
------------------------------

The cursor writer follows a wrapping model compatible with traditional
VT100-style terminals. This behavior is slightly different from a naïve
“wrap immediately at the edge” approach.

When writing characters near the right edge of the buffer:

* A character written into the **last column** does *not* immediately
  move the cursor to the next line.
* Instead, a *pending wrap* is recorded internally.
* The actual line break only happens **when the next character is written**.

This means:

* The last column can be filled without triggering an immediate line break.
* The next character causes the cursor to move to the beginning of the
  next line (if auto-wrap is enabled).

Wide characters (display width ``2``) are handled carefully:

* If a wide character would not fully fit at the end of the line:

  - With auto-wrap enabled, a line break occurs first.
  - With auto-wrap disabled, the character is ignored.

Additional details to keep in mind:

* If auto-wrap is disabled, writing at the right edge keeps the cursor
  pinned to the last column.
* Explicit cursor movement (e.g. ``moveCursor()``) clears any pending wrap.
* Line breaks triggered by wrapping use the configured overflow mode
  (wrap, shift, or expand).

This behavior ensures compatibility with terminal output expectations and
avoids subtle off-by-one rendering issues when mixing manual positioning
and streaming text.

Printing Wrapped Paragraphs
---------------------------

Both :cpp:any:`Terminal <erbsland::cterm::Terminal>` and
:cpp:any:`CursorBuffer <erbsland::cterm::CursorBuffer>` implement the same
paragraph-printing workflow via :cpp:any:`CursorWriter <erbsland::cterm::CursorWriter>`.

This allows you to reuse one paragraph configuration for direct terminal
output and for buffered, scrollable content.

.. code-block:: cpp

    auto options = ParagraphOptions::defaultOptions();
    options.setMaximumLineWraps(2);
    options.setParagraphSpacing(ParagraphSpacing::DoubleLine);

    logBuffer.printParagraph(
        "The same paragraph API works for live terminal output and for buffered history views.",
        options);

When writing to a :cpp:any:`Terminal <erbsland::cterm::Terminal>`, output is sent immediately to the active backend.

When writing to a :cpp:any:`CursorBuffer <erbsland::cterm::CursorBuffer>`, the output becomes part of the buffer
content and can later be rendered using
:cpp:any:`Terminal::updateScreen() <erbsland::cterm::Terminal::updateScreen()>` or displayed through a buffer view.

`printParagraph()` uses the current writer style as the base for any indentation or trailing padding that must be
materialized as spaces. If the wrapped paragraph should visually sit on a colored panel, set the writer background
before printing.

Choosing Between Terminal and CursorBuffer
------------------------------------------

Use :cpp:any:`Terminal <erbsland::cterm::Terminal>` when output should be written directly to the real console.

Use :cpp:any:`CursorBuffer <erbsland::cterm::CursorBuffer>` when you want to keep the same streaming API, but retain
the output for scrolling, clipping, copying, or re-rendering.

In practice, :cpp:any:`CursorWriter <erbsland::cterm::CursorWriter>` acts as the bridge between immediate output
and retained, in-memory rendering.
