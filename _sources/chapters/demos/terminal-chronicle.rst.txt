Terminal Chronicle
******************

``terminal-chronicle`` tells a short story using only ``Terminal::print()`` and ``Terminal::printLine()``. It is the
most direct example in the repository of colorful, structured terminal output without a back buffer or full-screen
render loop.

Use This Demo When You Need...
==============================

* A readable example of mixed text, colors, and formatting in ordinary command-line output.
* A support reference for status messages, splash screens, or narrated console output.
* A compact alternative to the fullscreen demos when you want simple print calls only.

Run the Demo
============

Start the demo from the build directory:

.. code-block:: console

    $ ./cmake-build-debug/demo-apps/terminal-chronicle

The program prints the full story directly into the terminal history and exits on its own.

Captured Output (80x25)
=======================

.. include:: _captures/terminal-chronicle.rstinc

Features Demonstrated
=====================

* Direct output via ``Terminal::print()`` and ``Terminal::printLine()``.
* Readable mixed argument lists combining plain text, colors, and formatting state.
* Inline foreground and background changes inside one output flow.
* Structured command-line output without building or managing a ``Buffer`` first.

* :doc:`Display All Colors <display-all-colors>` for a palette-focused reference of the built-in ANSI colors.
* :doc:`Minimum Effort <minimum-effort>` for the next step up into full-screen retained-buffer rendering.
