/// These modes are most visible when the rendered text uses a non-default background color and the paragraph wraps
/// across multiple physical lines. Depending on the chosen mode, the renderer can extend that background into the
/// unused cells on the right side of a wrapped line, into the indentation area of the continuation line, or both.
///
/// For buffer-based text rendering such as `Text` and `WritableBuffer::drawText()`, untouched cells keep the existing
/// buffer background. For cursor-writer output such as `CursorWriter::printParagraph()`, indentation and padding must
/// be materialized as spaces, so cells not covered by wrapped-text background use the writer's current background.
